Prefabulator Github Page: https://github.com/TwidgeVR/attprefabulator.git

1. Download the latest prefabulator release
  (from the github page)

2. Unzip the file
  (I use winrar but i still dont think it matters)

3. now open the only files
  (till you see more than just one)

4. Now open the attPrefabulator Application in that folder
  (I would recommend making a shortcut for it)

You now have Prefabulator open! :)
