## string transcoder

I would like to also mention a tool called string transcoder, however it is more complex and hard to explain

but to put it simpily using my knowledge, it is a type of "coding language" used to create strings

(I also don't even use it so i couldn't even explain it much)

here's their discord: https://discord.gg/ZrdccmdmkE
